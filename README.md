# ESC result extractor
A simple Pyhton script that extracts results from the official Eurovision website

* Highly unmaintainable since the Eurovision website gets revamped every other year
  * So chances are this will be broken in about 6 months because this table has moved or that URL isn't available anymore
* See requirements in txt file
* Coded with Python 3, Python 2.X compatibility not tested
